# CNN MNIST Classifier

## Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. The CNN learns patterns in the images, such as lines, curves, and loops, and can predict digits it has never seen before with high accuracy.



## Features
- **CNN Architecture**: Multiple convolutional and pooling layers to extract features.
- **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting during training.
- **Training & Validation**: Tracks both training and validation accuracy over epochs.
- **Single Image Prediction**: Test the model on individual handwritten digit images.



## Installation
